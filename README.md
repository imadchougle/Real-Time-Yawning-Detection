**Abstract:** This code implements a yawn detection and alert system using computer vision techniques and alerts the user if the user yawns 4 times continue an Alert Audio is played. dlib library to detect facial landmarks focusing on the position of the upper and lower lip. By calculating the distance between these lip points the code identifies yawning

The code keeps track of consecutive frames where a yawn is detected to avoid false alarms. The threshold for consecutive yawns is set to ensure accurate detection.

This Yawn Detection and Alert System provides a practical solution for monitoring and addressing drowsiness in real-time, its one of the major part of drowsiness

Very useful in contexts where alertness and attention are required such as driving or working.
